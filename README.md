# Rustwall

Network firewall for seL4, written in Rust.

The firewall itself is meant to replace [this Camkes firewall component](https://github.com/seL4/camkes-vm/blob/master/components/Firewall/src/firewall.c). 

Rustwall uses (currenlt a modified version of) [smoltcp](https://github.com/podhrmic/smoltcp/tree/sel4) as its network stack. The hope is to eventually merge the changes into the upstream.

## Features
Rustwall is configured with a configuration XML file (a sample [here](https://github.com/podhrmic/smoltcp/tree/sel4)).

Current status:
- rx/tx UDP packets only
- only on explicitly allowed ports (from `config.xml`)
- FFI bindings for additional external packet inspection are provided

## Deployment
To be used in a true seL4 environment, Rustwall has to be compiled using [rust-camkes](https://github.com/aisamanra/rust-camkes-samples). This is currently work in progress, more info will follow.

## Testing
If you don't have access to [seL4 supported hardware](https://wiki.sel4.systems/CMA34DBMC), you can test a simple UDP server behind the firewall.

In order to do so:
```
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/podhrmic/rustwall.git
cd rustwall

# open tap interface
./init.sh

# compile static libraries
make

# clone the modified smotcp version
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/podhrmic/smoltcp.git
cd smoltcp
git checkout sel4

# dont forget to make symlinks to the static libraries
$ ln -s ../rustwall/libfirewall.a libfirewall.a
$ ln -s ../rustwall/libserver.a libserver.a


# run the example
cargo run --example server_sel4 --features phy-client
```

From a different terminal window you can now communicate with the server on ports 6969 and 6942:
```
# returns reversed data
$ socat stdio udp4-connect:192.168.69.3:6942 <<<"abcdefg"
gfedcba
# returns hello
$ socat stdio udp4-connect:192.168.69.3:6969 <<<"abcdefg"
hello
```
